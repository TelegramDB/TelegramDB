# TelegramDB
**TelegramDB** is a service that allows you to search for channels, groups and their members.

Through our [bot](https://t.me/tgdb_bot) on Telegram you can search, using our database, for all public groups in which a user has been.

The bot is also a **search engine**, you can search by filtering by groups and channels, and get many more results than a normal search on Telegram.

## Why TelegramDB?
We aim to make it **easier** and **straightforward** to access all the useful information on Telegram.

## How to use TelegramDB?
Through [@tgdb_bot](https://t.me/tgdb_bot) you can use our service.

### üÜì Free features.
- **/search** allows you to use keywords to search for groups and channels.
If you want to filter only groups or channels instead, you can use the corresponding /group and /channel commands.
- **/resolve** allows you to convert the id and username of a user, group or channel.

### ‚≠êÔ∏è Premium functions.
- **/where** allows you to get a list of groups in which a user has been.
- **advanced search**: Through the use of credits, it is possible to extend the functions of the /search command and get more results, and export them to csv.
### How to use premium functions?
In order to use the premium functions, you will have to purchase **credits**.
The purchase procedure will be done through the bot, using the /credits command.
You can easily pay thanks to the built-in system on Telegram.

Premium searches, compared to free searches, have more results.

User searches, on the other hand, have a base price to be performed; the cost is proportional to the number of results obtained.

You will always preview the cost and the number of results you will get before you spend the credits.

#### üîé **search**
- Free: 20 results
- Base price: 0 credits
- Every 40 results: 1 credit

#### üåç **where**
- Free: Number of groups a user is in. (Up to 5 per day if you do not own credits)
- Base price: 3 credits
- Every 40 results: 1 credit
